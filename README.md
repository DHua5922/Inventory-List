# Supply-List
Android application that keeps track of items and their amount left

## Development Tools
* **Programming Language:** Kotlin
* **Markup Language:** XML
* **Database Technologies:** SQL, SQLite Database
* **Integrated Development Environment:** Android Studio

## How Application Works
The user enters the item name and the amount left. The fields cannot be empty, and quantity can only be integers. After the add button is tapped, the item is added to the supply list. The items in the supply list can be updated anytime. Each item in the supply list can be deleted by tapping the delete button. The list is saved in a SQLite database, so the user can still view the same list even if the application is exited out.
